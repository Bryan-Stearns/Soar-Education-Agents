        ^option ID                # (2) The two options, without preference. (This allows easy querying for this structure from smem.)
        ^preferred-option ID      # (1) Which option to prefer of two competitors (points to the same ID as given in input)

                                  #       If reason-attribute is given, tells whether it was 
                                  #       because the preferred-option had a positive association with it, or
                                  #       because the rejected-option had a negative association with it.
